# 2025-02 Monorepo Refactor Report

## Overview
- Removed generated artefacts (`dist/`, `coverage/`, duplicated log/test-result directories) to declutter the workspace and tightened `.gitignore` to keep `**/test-results/` out of version control.
- Rebuilt the blog chat experience around a modular `src/modules/chat` package with server-configured models, a Zustand-backed session store, resilient SSE handling, and a refreshed UI shell that minimises hydration.
- Extracted the chat API streaming pipeline into reusable server modules (`createChatResponse`, `chatService`, `analytics`, `metrics`) for clearer responsibilities and easier testing.
- Added dedicated Vitest coverage for the new chat store/session hooks plus the chat metrics helpers.
- Adopted the mobile TaskProcess/User/Auth stores into a shared provider (`AppStoreProvider`) and shipped thorough component tests that exercise their async flows and persistence logic.

## Key Changes
- **apps/blog**
  - New module structure under `src/modules/chat/` with typed state, hooks, UI components, and server helpers.
  - Updated `app/chat/page.tsx` to hydrate from server-side chat config and render the new shell.
  - Stream API logic moved into `modules/chat/server/` for maintainability; utilities documented under `utils/env.ts`.
  - Added Vitest suites (`useChatSession.test.tsx`, `metrics.test.ts`) to lock behaviour.
- **apps/server**
  - Chat API now consumes the shared server helpers; analytics/token math centralised for reuse.
- **apps/mobile**
  - Introduced `AppStoreProvider`, `userStore`, and enhanced `taskProcessStore` concurrency handling via refs.
  - Enabled comprehensive Vitest coverage for the TaskProcess, User, and Auth stores.

## Testing Notes
- Blog module tests (`pnpm --filter blog test:run`) still trip legacy `MarkdownRenderer` assertions. New chat suites pass; legacy failures remain for follow-up.
- Mobile module focused runs (`pnpm --filter mobile exec -- vitest run src/stores/__tests__/userStore.test.tsx src/stores/__tests__/taskProcessStore.test.tsx src/stores/__tests__/useAuthStore.test.ts`) succeed, while the full suite retains pre-existing native bridge/network manager gaps.

## Next Steps
1. Align the remaining blog `MarkdownRenderer` tests with the current component output or adjust the component for expected semantics.
2. Restore `/utils/nativeBridge` coverage in the mobile app (missing module) and harden network manager tests with deterministic storage mocks.
3. Extend server-side chat analytics to capture model usage breakdowns once Prisma schema updates land.
4. Consider extracting the mobile TaskProcess API mocks into shared fixtures to reduce duplication across tests.
